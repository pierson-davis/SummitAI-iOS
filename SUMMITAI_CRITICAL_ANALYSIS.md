- **Resource Allocation**: Insufficient budget for proper testing
- **Quality Assurance**: No dedicated QA team specified

#### **2. Maintenance Challenges**
- **HealthKit Updates**: Apple frequently changes HealthKit APIs
- **Firebase Changes**: Google changes Firebase without notice
- **iOS Updates**: New iOS versions may break functionality
- **Third-party Dependencies**: External services may discontinue
